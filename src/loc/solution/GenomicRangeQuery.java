		 * A DNA sequence can be represented as a string consisting of the letters A, C, G and T,
		 * which correspond to the types of successive nucleotides in the sequence. Each nucleotide
		 * has an impact factor, which is an integer. Nucleotides of types A, C, G and T have impact
		 * factors of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. You are going to answer several queries of the form:
		 * What is the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained in a particular part of the given
		 * DNA sequence?
		 * The DNA sequence is given as a non-empty string S = S[0]S[1]...S[N-1] consisting of N 
		 * characters. There are M queries, which are given in non-empty arrays P and Q, each consisting
		 * of M integers. The K-th query (0 â‰¤ K < M) requires you to find the minimal impact factor of
		 * nucleotides contained in the DNA sequence between positions P[K] and Q[K] (inclusive).

		 * For example, consider string S = CAGCCTA and arrays P, Q such that:
         *
		 *		    P[0] = 2    Q[0] = 4
		 *		    P[1] = 5    Q[1] = 5
		 *		    P[2] = 0    Q[2] = 6
		 *
		 * The answers to these M = 3 queries are as follows:
		 * The part of the DNA between positions 2 and 4 contains nucleotides G and C (twice), whose impact
		 * factors are 3 and 2 respectively, so the answer is 2.
		 * The part between positions 5 and 5 contains a single nucleotide T, whose impact factor is 4, so 
		 * the answer is 4.
		 * The part between positions 0 and 6 (the whole string) contains all nucleotides, in particular
		 * nucleotide A whose impact factor is 1, so the answer is 1.
